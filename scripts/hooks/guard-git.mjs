/**
 * PreToolUse hook. Refuses a Bash command that would damage state SHARED between git worktrees.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PREVENTS: a task agent running in a linked worktree reaching past its branch. The
 * object store, the packed refs and the trunk branch itself are shared with every sibling worktree,
 * so `git push origin main`, `git gc` and `git worktree remove` are not local mistakes -- they land on
 * work an agent cannot see and did not consent to. `.worktree/CONTEXT.md` asks the agent not to do
 * this, but context is advice; this is the part that holds.
 *
 * THE GIT RULES ARE A NO-OP IN THE PRIMARY CHECKOUT. AGENTS.md § Git workflow forbids pushing to,
 * switching to or rewriting a protected branch from a worktree; the primary checkout is where a
 * person works, and what they commit or push there is theirs to decide. So the guard asks git
 * whether the command runs in a linked worktree and skips every git rule if not. The PR-base,
 * merge-bypass, worktree-prune and graphify rules below are the exceptions and apply everywhere,
 * because what they guard is not worktree isolation. Where the command runs is the payload's `cwd`, never `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`;
 * `commandDir` below says what reading the variable cost.
 *
 * IT FAILS CLOSED, unlike the three advisory hooks beside it. A guard that allows the command when
 * it cannot read the payload is not a guard: the shell version of this file needed `jq`, which is
 * not installed here, and its `[ -z "$cmd" ] && exit 0` therefore allowed every command -- including
 * the one command it existed to stop.
 *
 * IT PARSES, it does not glob. The shell version matched substrings of the raw command, which
 * refused `git push origin agent/BD-12-fix-main-nav`, `git switch development` and
 * `echo 'see docs/git worktree notes'` while allowing `git -C /repo push origin main` and
 * `git push --all`. Wrong in both directions. Commands here are split into statements, tokenised
 * quote-aware, and matched on the git SUBCOMMAND and the resolved REF.
 *
 * IT REFUSES EVERY GIT CALL IN A STRAY WORKTREE DIRECTORY: one under `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`
 * where git answers for another checkout, which is what a worktree removed under a live session
 * leaves once the session writes a file there (`strayWorktreeDir` below, and its incident).
 *
 * IT ALSO GUARDS THE PR BASE, EVERYWHERE. `gh pr create` with no `--base` uses the repository's
 * DEFAULT branch: a GitHub setting that lives outside this repository, that this guard cannot read,
 * and that need not be the trunk. Whoever omits the flag gets whatever that setting says when the
 * command runs, and the mistake is invisible until a human looks. The rule does not rest on `main`
 * being protected on GitHub, and it is not: on 2026-09-23 the branch-protection endpoint answered
 * 404 and the rulesets applying to `main` were empty. The trunk is `main`; the base is typed, never
 * inferred (AGENTS.md § Git workflow). That has nothing to do with worktrees, so unlike the git
 * rules it is enforced in the primary checkout too.
 *
 * IT ALSO GUARDS THE APPROVAL AND THE MERGE PAST THE CHECKS, EVERYWHERE. It refuses `gh pr review`
 * with `--approve`, since the trunk's ruleset merges a head once `verify` passes and one approving
 * review stands, and the reviewer approves every head off the high-risk floor itself: an approval a
 * session gives is a person's approval of a head on the floor, and a session holding any login with
 * write could otherwise give it. It refuses `gh pr merge` with `--admin`,
 * which merges with the maintainer's bypass of the checks the ruleset requires, the same head's
 * merge. From a worktree it lets `gh pr merge --auto` through, which only
 * asks GitHub to merge once the ruleset is met, and refuses any other merge as the orchestrator's
 * call. No incident yet: were either rule wrong, an agent could merge a pull request no person read.
 * Until 2026-10-05 it guarded the reviewer's approval label in the same
 * place, which retired with the label. It reads only the command line, so an approval or a merge
 * through `gh api`, curl, a browser tool or the web UI passes it.
 *
 *   printf '%s' '{"tool_input":{"command":"gh pr review 1 --approve"}}' | node scripts/hooks/guard-git.mjs
 *   printf '%s' '{"tool_input":{"command":"gh pr merge 1 --admin --rebase"}}' | node scripts/hooks/guard-git.mjs
 *
 * IT ALSO REFUSES A BARE `git worktree prune`, EVERYWHERE. git cannot tell a removed worktree from
 * one whose path it cannot see, and in a dev container on a bind-mounted clone every worktree made on
 * the host is the second kind. A session there works in the primary checkout, where the git rules
 * are off, so a prune it typed would take every host worktree's record. On 2026-10-06 a prune run in
 * such a container, by the WorktreeRemove hook through a pre-push selftest, left git with no record
 * of any of the host's worktrees. Its `--dry-run` passes.
 *
 * IT ALSO GUARDS THE LOCAL CODE GRAPH, EVERYWHERE. It refuses graphify's `update`, `watch`, `hook
 * install` and `claude install` (`GRAPHIFY_ERODING` below), run by name or as a Python module,
 * because the first three rebuild the graph through the path that erodes its document layer and the
 * last writes graphify's advice to run `update` into CLAUDE.md. It lets
 * one through that asks for help, which graphify answers with a line of help alone. It holds in the
 * primary checkout too, because that is where the graph is built. No session has
 * run one here yet. Were this rule wrong, a session following graphify's own advice, which its
 * user-level skill and the block `claude install` writes both give, would erode the graph: on
 * 2026-10-01, on a clone holding a copy of the first graph, two `graphify update` runs took its
 * concept nodes from 157 to 22 and its links between documents and code from 898 to 156. It
 * reads a statement that opens with graphify, after any environment assignments, so graphify behind
 * a launcher (`env`, `uvx`, `pipx run`) or a shell word (`nohup`, `time`, `then`), in `bash -lc` or
 * `eval`, or its library called through `python -c`, as graphify's own skill runs its `--update`,
 * passes it; the git rules above miss the same shell forms.
 *
 * Exit 2 is the documented way for a PreToolUse hook to block, and stderr becomes the reason shown
 * to the agent -- which is what turns a blocked attempt into a course correction rather than a
 * confused retry loop.
