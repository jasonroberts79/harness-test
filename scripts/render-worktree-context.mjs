/**
 * Allocate a worktree's pair of ports and render its briefing from the template beside this file.
 *
 * Prints `KEY=value` lines on stdout for the caller to read, and writes two files into the
 * worktree: `.worktree/CONTEXT.md`, the briefing rendered from `.harness/worktree-CONTEXT.md.tmpl`,
 * and `.worktree/ports.env`, the pair. This script is the one reader of `ports.env`: it reads every
 * sibling worktree's copy, so as not to hand out a pair already promised. A server a person starts
 * in the worktree is given `APP_PORT` as its `PORT`.
 *
 * The failures it exists to prevent. It is a separate Node file rather than more shell because of
 * the first three, each a defect the shell version had:
 *
 * 1. `sed "s|{{X}}|<value>|"` treats `&` in the REPLACEMENT as "the whole match" and `\` as an
 *    escape. Verified: a path containing `a&b` rendered as `a{{WORKTREE_PATH}}b`, silently, with a
 *    zero exit code. Substitution here is a replacer FUNCTION, so every value is literal.
 * 2. `date -u -d "+2 hours"` is GNU-only. On a BSD or busybox `date` the shell script aborted
 *    AFTER creating the worktree and branch, leaving both behind.
 * 3. The ports were `hash % 900` with nothing checking them. They are probed here, so the header's
 *    "non-colliding" claim is true rather than a hope.
 * 4. The template is the one beside this file (`ROOT` below has no override), so the copy of this
 *    script that runs decides which template renders. `scripts/new-worktree.sh` ran the primary
 *    checkout's copy, whose working tree can trail the base a worktree is cut from. On 2026-09-23
 *    a worktree cut from `origin/main` opened with the template the checkout had at an older
 *    commit, still carrying a sentence the base had replaced. On 2026-09-25 another, cut while the
 *    checkout stood behind the base, was told to open its pull request with an inline
 *    `gh pr create`, a step the base had replaced with the `open-pr` skill; `AGENTS.md` gives the
 *    briefing precedence, so the stale step won. The caller now runs the new worktree's own copy, so the briefing is the
 *    base's template, whatever state the primary checkout is in.
 *
 *   node <worktree-path>/scripts/render-worktree-context.mjs \
 *     <worktree-path> <branch> <base-sha> <task-ref> [hours]
 *
 * Called by `scripts/new-worktree.sh`, from the new worktree's checkout. Needs `git` on PATH, for
 * the list of sibling worktrees, and binds loopback ports for a moment to probe them.
