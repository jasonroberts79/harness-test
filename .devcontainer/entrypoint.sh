# The container's own clone of the repository, made at the first start in the workspace volume
# devcontainer.json mounts, since no host checkout is mounted, and then the steps only the container
# can take, because each one reads that clone or the volume and neither exists at build time:
#
#   1. the clone                  -- clone(), from the policy the image holds, at the first start.
#   2. ~/.claude's ownership      -- a volume made before the image had that directory arrives
#                                    root-owned.
#   3. the commit identity        -- the agents' GitHub App's bot account, read from the clone's
#                                    policy, set when ~/.gitconfig has no email.
#   4. Claude Code's status line  -- .devcontainer/statusline.sh, set in the volume's settings when
#                                    they set none: a volume made before the image changed keeps
#                                    what it held.
#
# ...and then scripts/bootstrap.mjs --container --warn-only, the one home of every setup step a
# program can run, which the host runs too: `npm ci`, the git hooks, the Tracker's hydration, the
# plugins and installed skills of policy/skill-sources.json, and last the doctor, whose probes
# replace the warnings this file once printed itself (a tool mise.toml pins missing from the image,
# a GitHub App that cannot mint a token). Before bootstrap existed this file held those steps and
# the README held the host's, and the two drifted.
#
# Wired to ENTRYPOINT by the Dockerfile so that devcontainer.json needs no lifecycle command. Runs
# on every container start, which is why every step below is idempotent and cheap when there is
# nothing to do.
#
# Nothing here is allowed to fail the container. This is the process that starts the shell you would
# use to fix a setup problem; exiting non-zero would lock you out of it. Every step warns and
# carries on, and bootstrap gets --warn-only for the same reason.
