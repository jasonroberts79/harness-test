/**
 * `mise run citations:selftest` -- does the citation scanner still BITE?
 *
 * A resolution gate has one characteristic failure and it is not a false alarm: it is going quietly
 * green. Narrow the regex by a character, resolve a path one strategy too eagerly, or let the
 * section matcher accept any line at all, and `citations:check` prints the same reassuring summary
 * over a repository it is no longer checking. Nothing in the repository's own citations would say
 * so, because the gate passing IS the expected outcome.
 *
 * So this holds the scanner to synthetic fixtures where the answer is known: every failure it is
 * supposed to catch, and -- just as important -- every shape it must NOT report, because a gate that
 * cries wolf is deleted and then checks nothing at all. Section 6 is the other half: the gate itself,
 * run end to end through `CITATIONS_ROOT` over a git tree built under the temporary directory, must
 * find exactly the citations that tree holds, and each doctored copy of the tree must fail for the
 * one reason it was doctored for.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS FILE HAD, dated 2026-09-23: nothing ran it. `package.json` had no
 * `citations:selftest`, so no pre-push job or CI step did, and run by hand it failed on a repository
 * the gate passed. Its repository-level floor asserted more than twenty `<file>.md:NN` citations in a
 * repository that legitimately has none, and its memory-rule fixtures asserted an exemption for the
 * tracker's generated block, which `MEMORY_EXEMPT_REGIONS` registers only once the block exists. A
 * floor on the repository's own content fails for a reason no commit repairs, and a fixture held to
 * the live registry breaks whenever the registry legitimately changes. Section 6 now counts a tree
 * whose answer is known by construction, and section 7 holds the region shapes to its own registry.
 *
 *   mise run citations:selftest
 *
 * Needs `git` on PATH, to build the synthetic tree; no `../sibling` checkout and no network.
