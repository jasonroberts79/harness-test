/**
 * Self-test for scripts/hooks/worktree-create.mjs, scripts/hooks/worktree-remove.mjs,
 * scripts/render-worktree-context.mjs with the briefing template it renders,
 * scripts/new-worktree.sh's choice of which copy of that template renders, its run beside
 * another that holds `.git/config.lock`
 * and the branch a failed run of it made, and for the hook registrations in
 * the rendered Claude settings: each must load
 * whatever the session's working directory is (the last section says what broke).
 *
 * Covers the halves of the contract that are cheap to exercise and easy to get wrong: what the hooks
 * accept on stdin, what they refuse, and -- for the remove hook -- that stdout stays clean and the
 * sandbox fallback actually deletes a directory `git worktree remove` will not touch. It deliberately
 * does NOT provision a real worktree: `git worktree add` needs the primary checkout, and a
 * worktree-isolated session is refused it by scripts/hooks/guard-git.mjs. That one round trip is
 * verified by running the create hook from the primary checkout. The new-worktree
 * case runs the script only in a scratch repository of its own.
 *
 *   node scripts/hooks/worktree-hooks.selftest.mjs
 *
 * Needs `git`, `bash` and a POSIX `sh` on PATH. It reads nothing outside the temporary directory
 * but this checkout's own files. The render and new-worktree cases bind loopback ports for a moment,
 * as the renderer's port probe does.

 *
 * THE GAP. This suite is the template's and the renderer's selftest, and until 2026-09-25 no case
 * here read either, so a change to the template ran a selftest that passed without looking at it.
 * Two template changes were proved by a render run by hand into `.scratch/` instead: one on
 * 2026-09-23, and the port paragraphs on 2026-09-24.
 *
 * The renderer and the committed template are COPIED into a scratch checkout, because the renderer
 * finds the template beside itself and has no root override: run in place, a write relative to its own
 * checkout would land in this one. The copy runs from an empty directory, and every file under the
 * scratch root is listed afterwards, so a write anywhere but the path it was handed shows. The values
 * are hostile on purpose: `&` and `\` are what `sed` mangled (the renderer's header records `a&b`
 * rendering as `a{{WORKTREE_PATH}}b`), and `$&`, `$$` and `$1` are what `String.replace` expands when
 * it is handed a replacement string rather than a function.
 *
 * The control is the committed template, which must render clean. The negative is the same template
 * with a placeholder the renderer does not supply, which must be refused by its reason with nothing
 * written: without it, a renderer that lost its leftover check would still pass the control.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *
 * .claude/settings.json: every registered hook loads whatever the working directory is.
 *
 * THE INCIDENT. Every hook was registered as `node scripts/hooks/<name>.mjs`,
 * a path relative to the directory the harness runs a hook in, which is the session's current one.
 * On 2026-09-25, after a Bash `cd docs`, the Stop hook failed with "Cannot find module
 * .../docs/scripts/hooks/gate-summary.mjs" and printed no verdict, and `guard-git.mjs` failed to
 * load the same way; its exit 1 does not block, so the next command ran unguarded. Each command now
 * names its script through `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`.
 *
 * Each registered command runs as the harness runs a command hook, through `sh -c` with
 * `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` naming this checkout, from a subdirectory of it (the incident's shape) and
 * from a directory outside it. The `node` first on PATH is a stand-in that reports the script it was
 * handed and runs nothing, because `worktree-create.mjs` provisions a real worktree when it runs. So
 * every command must be `node <script>`: that is what lets this case test one without running it.
 *
 * The control is the old relative form from the checkout root, which must load; the negative is the
 * same form from the subdirectory, which must be refused for that reason. Without the pair, a
 * stand-in that refused everything, or loaded everything, would pass every case below it.
