#
# Creates one isolated worktree per agent task: a branch off origin/main, a checked pair of
# ports, and a rendered .worktree/CONTEXT.md briefing that the committed AGENTS.md asks each session to read.
#
# There is no database, container stack or .env to provision -- this repository is a Node/TypeScript
# toolchain. An earlier version of this script copied .env, certs and appsettings.Development.json
# and wrote COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME/DB_NAME/DB_PORT into .env; none of those files or services exist
# here, so every line of it was inert. The port pair is reserved so that two worktrees never
# collide: the first is the PORT to give a server a person starts there, the second is unused.
# scripts/render-worktree-context.mjs owns the pair.
#
# It also does not install dependencies. node_modules is gitignored and platform-native, so the new
# checkout has none; `npm ci` is the first command inside the worktree, and both the summary printed
# below and the rendered briefing say so.
#
# Several runs at once, as a fan-out sweep starts them, do not fail one another: no run writes the
# shared .git/config, and a run that fails deletes the branch it made, and only that one
# (the block that cuts the branch has the incident).
#
# Run from the primary checkout.

# Two calling conventions. `<task-ref> <slug>` is the orchestrator's, and the one the briefing's

# to split it back into a bead ref and a slug. Both forms land on the same NAME, so there is one code
# path below and no second way for a worktree to get provisioned.

# The branch is cut with --no-track, and before the worktree, in two steps. On 2026-09-26 a fan-out
# sweep launched eleven lanes at once and two WorktreeCreate hooks failed with "could not lock config
# file .git/config: File exists": `git worktree add -b ... origin/main` set the
# new branch's upstream, a write to the one `.git/config` every worktree shares, and concurrent runs
# race for its lock. On 2026-10-03, 30 concurrent runs of a scratch copy failed 3 times so, and 50 of
# this one none. With --no-track no run writes the config at all, so there is no lock to race for,
# nothing to retry and no serialising lock of this script's own to leave stale; nor two keys per
# branch left behind in the shared config. The branch needs no upstream:
# the briefing rebases onto origin/main by name, `open-pr`'s `git push -u` sets the pushed branch as
# the upstream, and `mise run gates` reads a branch with none as new, from its merge base with
# origin/main (scripts/git-hooks.mjs). Where it loses: a bare `git pull --rebase` in a worktree not
# yet pushed, which rebased onto origin/main, now stops on git's "no tracking information" until the
# push; `git pull --rebase origin main` names the base. The second step is what lets the trap tell
# its own branch from another's: `git worktree add -b` makes the branch and then fails on an
# occupied path, so its exit status cannot say whether the branch it failed with was its own.
